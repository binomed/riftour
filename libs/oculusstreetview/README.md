Oculus Street View
==================

Fork of [Oculus Street View](http://oculusstreetview.eu.pn/) to work with [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js).

How to make it work
-------------------

* Install [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js) (Windows and Mac only)
* Plug in your Rift
* Restart your browser (the Rift has to be plugged in when the plugin starts)
* Head over to http://steeve.github.io/oculusstreetview
* Enjoy the Eiffel Tower!
